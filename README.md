# Nas - Testing using ansible and zfs for my home nas.

I currently use Truenas for my home nas.
I was inspired by the [ansible-nas project](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas) and will probably end up creating something very similar.
I am creating this project instead of just using ansible-nas for learning and for customization.
